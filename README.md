# Interactive-Halloween-Pokemon-Poster
An interactive mini-game I made entirely with my own assets (drawings, voices) for ARTG 80G at UCSC.

A Very Spooky Interactive Pokemon Poster 

| Made In: p5.js

Walkthrough

Goal of the game is to find seven total hidden Pokemon and reveal their hidden letters in order to find the very mysterious secret word.

- Click on Lamp (Head) to turn on lamp. This will put a somewhat transparent yellow circle surrounding your cursor, this is basically your flashlight. Click again to turn off.

- Drag cursor around the screen to find hidden Pokemon. They will become visible near the light from your cursor, but you have to click on them while they're visible to reveal their "hidden letter".

- Once you get all hidden letters the secret word will be complete and the game is over. All features become disabled after game over. If you click on the screen during this time, I will thank you for playing the game.

Descriptions

This is pretty much a full on black-and-white mini-game instead of a colorful interactive poster. 

My initial idea was to make a game where you had to find hidden monsters using a single lamp in the middle of the screen. That idea came to fruition, but not in the way I really expected.

After making several poor decisions and having zero experience in p5.js, I ended up hand-drawing monsters (which I decided would be Pokemon) and putting them in my game. They looked "better than I thought" so I ended up committing to the idea of "shitty drawing aesthetic" and "zero-effort real life aesthetic", if you catch my drift. I even went as far as adding my own voice (extremely sick voice) so my game would be as annoying as possible.

I at least put some effort into selecting the Pokemon that shared some letters with the title "Pokemon".

All the interactivity here goes into clicking and dragging the mouse.

This is basically a horror game with negative percent efforts in trying to be horror.

But even though it looks like shit. I'm 100% positive more than 20 hours went into this, alongside my flesh, tears, and coughs.

Bugs:
- Noticeable one is that the last Pokemon that your light catches will remain in full visibility once the game ends. I have no brain power left to fix it.

- The amount of my voice in this project is not a bug.
